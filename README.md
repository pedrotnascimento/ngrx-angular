# NgrxExperiment

A marketplace which I will providing features aiming learning, applying new concepts and experimenting whatever the things in angular environment
At first started with NgRx features but can be extended to anything in Angular.


## Next Features:

- [ ] Test reducers

## Done features:
- [x] Working on NgRx with one item (its just like a click counter)
- [x] Working on NgRx editing a list values (manage data in a list)



## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
