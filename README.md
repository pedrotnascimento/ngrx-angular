# NgrxExperiment

A marketplace which I will be providing features aiming learning, applying new concepts and experimenting whatever the things in angular environment

At first started with NgRx features but can be extended to anything in Angular.


## Next Features:
- [ ] Put some animation for better visualization
- [ ] Test reducers

## Done features:
- [x] Working on NgRx with one item (its just like a click counter)
- [x] Working on NgRx editing a list values (manage data in a list)



## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
